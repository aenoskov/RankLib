What is ClueWebUtility:convertDataset2utf8
------------------------------------------

convertDataset2utf8 is a java tool which was written to convert each page of 
the ClueWeb09 dataset from its' original charset to utf-8.

The utility requires a source path and destination path.  There is an optional
third argument, sample destination path.  If this third argument is given, the 
utility will save every 100,000th page with the occurance of each charset to a 
directory inside the sample destination path.

usage:

java -jar convertDataset2utf8.jar /path/to/corpus/ \
                                  /path/to/save/converted/data \
                                  [/path/to/save/sample/data/]


The utility will traverse the source directory for all warc.gz files. It will 
convert the warc record to utf8 if the charset is found and supported and save 
the record to the destination with the same structure and filenames as the 
source. (Note that the corpus directory and file structure is assumed to be 
what was distributed with the original dataset)

If the utility cannot find a charset or does not recorgnize/support the 
charset given, the record is skipped.  The ClueWeb09 doccument id, url and 
reason for being skipped is printed to standard output.  After each warc.gz 
file is traversed, the statistics on the number of total records, number of  
unrecoginzed charsets, the number of records that the utility could not 
find the charset and the percentage of records skipped is printed to 
standard output.
